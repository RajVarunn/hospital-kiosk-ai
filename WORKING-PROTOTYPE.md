# Working Prototype - Hospital Kiosk AI

This is a working prototype of the Hospital Kiosk AI application that uses Amazon Bedrock for health assessments.

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to the `/direct-bedrock` route in your application
2. Enter symptoms and vitals
3. Click "Generate Health Assessment"
4. You'll get a health assessment generated by Amazon Bedrock

## How It Works

The DirectBedrockTest component makes a direct API call to a Bedrock proxy API that has the necessary permissions to call the Bedrock service. This bypasses the need for setting up IAM permissions on your Lambda function.

## Implementation Details

1. **DirectBedrockTest.jsx**: A React component that collects symptoms and vitals from the user and displays the health assessment.

2. **App.tsx**: Updated to include the DirectBedrockTest component.

3. **bedrock-proxy.js**: A simple proxy API for Bedrock (optional, if you want to host your own proxy).

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate with your existing application**: You can copy the relevant parts of DirectBedrockTest.jsx into your BedrockTest.jsx component.

2. **Set up your own proxy API**: Follow the instructions in PROXY-DEPLOYMENT.md to set up your own proxy API.

3. **Add authentication**: Add authentication to secure your API.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the browser console**: Look for any errors in the browser console.

2. **Try a different model**: If Claude is not available, try a different model like "amazon.titan-text-express-v1".

3. **Check CORS settings**: Make sure CORS is properly configured in your API Gateway.

4. **Check network requests**: Use the browser's network tab to see the requests and responses.
